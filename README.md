# NYC-Airbnb-Analysis
This project meant to give some directions for me as I am going to NYC for a field trip with my parents and I decided to perform a bit of research to see where is the most popular and affordable places to rent out a space for us to have fun. 

I asked myself some questions that I would like to solve to see which borough of NYC should I rent.

## Tasks:
### <span style = 'color: cornflowerblue'> 1. Which borough in NYC has the largest number of rentals?</span>
### <span style = 'color: cornflowerblue'> 2. How neighborhoods influence Airbnb prices?</span>
### <span style = 'color: cornflowerblue'> 3. Which borough of NYC has the highest price range?</span>
### <span style = 'color: cornflowerblue'> 4. Which period of time in a year has the largest number of rentals?</span>

Then, I retrieved data from Inside Airbnb about Airbnb listings in 5 boroughs. Data consists of prices, listings, host information, date, reviews and so on. 

I cleaned the datasets taking out unrelated columns and duplicates. Put them into visuals in Tableau.
